new project


need to change ncd pipelone to a kreinsvm 

we got the code to fit a svm in a RKKS space.

what ewe need is to change the kernel matrix to a ncd-based one.


code for a ncd kernel matrix creator:


def ncd_kernel(x_images, y_images, parameters=None):
    n1 = len(x_images)
    n2 = len(y_images)
    k = np.zeroes((n1,n2))
    for x in x_images:
        for y in y_images:
        k[x,y] = ncd(x,y)
    return k
# ncd_matrix

y_images needs to be a array of np objects

we need to feed the matrix to?


Model = SquareHingeKernelSVM()

Model.fit(ncd_matrix, x_images)

after we get the fit...

we need to predict the results:
Model.predict(y_images)
predictions = Model.predict(y_images)


out_params = Model.get_params()

Prediction = SquareHingeKernelSVM.predict(y_images)



# afazeres

mudar o ncd_apply para ficar 100% certo com o ncd_kernelmatrix

experimentar a classe




can only feed same n of matrix as an array to train
